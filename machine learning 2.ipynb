    "Regularization in machine learning is a technique used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data.

    "* **L2 regularization:** L2 regularization penalizes the model for the squared value of its weights. This tends to produce smooth models, where the weights are evenly distributed.\n",
    "* **Dropout:** Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly disables neurons during training. This forces the model to learn to rely on multiple neurons to make predictions, which helps to prevent overfitting.\n",

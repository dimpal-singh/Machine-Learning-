    "**Filter methods** are a type of feature selection method that uses statistical measures to select features. They are independent of any machine learning algorithm, and can be used as a preprocessing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter methods work by ranking features based on their relevance to the target variable. This relevance is typically measured using statistical tests such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlation coefficient:** This measure assesses the linear relationship between two variables. A high correlation coefficient indicates that the two variables are strongly correlated, and therefore that the feature is likely to be informative for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "* **Information gain:** This measure assesses the amount of information that a feature provides about the target variable. A high information gain indicates that the feature is likely to be useful for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "* **Chi-squared test:** This measure assesses the independence of two categorical variables. A low chi-squared test p-value indicates that the two variables are not independent, and therefore that the feature is likely to be informative for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the features have been ranked, the filter method selects a subset of the top-ranked features. The number of features to select is typically determined by a tuning parameter, such as the desired accuracy or the maximum number of features allowed.\n",
